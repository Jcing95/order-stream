## Project Overview

**Order Stream** is a simple and efficient tool for streamlining food and drink logistics at small events. Built as a Leptos full-stack web application using the Axum web server.

### Purpose
Order Stream helps event organizers manage food and beverage orders efficiently by providing a streamlined interface for order taking, tracking, and fulfillment at small events like parties, meetups, or community gatherings.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Leptos with WebAssembly compilation
- **Backend**: Axum server 
- **Database**: SurrealDB (relational)
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live order updates
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end tests
- **Build Tool**: cargo-leptos

## Architecture

### Station-Based Workflow
Order Stream is designed around stationary devices at different stations:

**Order Flow:**
1. **Cash Register** (1-2 tablets): Staff takes orders, marks items as ordered after payment
2. **Preparation Stations** (Bar/Food/Kitchen/Drinks): See real-time orders filtered by category
3. **Fulfillment**: Staff mark items as "ready" then "completed" when handed out

**Key Features:**
- Real-time order synchronization via WebSockets
- Category-based filtering (customizable: Drinks, Food, etc.)
- Trust-based system (no customer order numbers displayed)
- Order tracking with backend order numbers for future expansion
- Role-optimized UI views for each station type
- Order grouping for customer context and basic verification

**User Roles:**
- **Admin**: Full system configuration, menu management, and all permissions
- **Cashier**: Create/cancel orders, mark orders as paid
- **Staff**: View orders, update order states (ready/completed)

**Account Types:**
- **Personal accounts**: Individual login on personal devices
- **Stationary accounts**: Shared accounts for station tablets

**Order States:**
`draft` (synced for offline resilience) â†’ `ordered` (after payment) â†’ `ready` â†’ `completed` (or `cancelled`)

**Order Completion:**
- Per-category completion (drinks complete separately from food)
- Full order completion when all categories are done
- Category-specific visibility (completed items disappear from relevant stations)

**Device Management:**
- Account-based login for role assignment
- URL-based view switching (/cashier, /bar, /kitchen, etc.)
- Event-based organization with EventID tracking

**Data Model:**
- **Orders**: Sequential ID, EventID, timestamp, total price, status
- **Items**: Name, category, current price (admin-managed only)
- **OrderItems**: Links orders to items with quantity, paid price, and category-specific status
- **Categories**: Customizable (Drinks, Food, etc.)
- **Users**: Role-based accounts (Admin/Cashier/Staff), personal or stationary
- **Events**: For historical tracking and multi-event support
- **StateChanges**: Audit trail tracking when order states change (for analytics)

**Station Views:**
- Filtered by category but show order context
- Expandable order cards to reveal full order details
- Visual grouping by order for customer verification

**Admin Configuration:**
- User accounts (roles, permissions, personal vs stationary)
- Menu items and pricing (exclusive admin control)
- Categories and station types
- Station layout (which categories each station sees)
- Order display settings (completion timeout, visual preferences)
- Event management and settings
- System monitoring (connected devices, connection status)
- Backup and export (order data, analytics, configuration)
- Order history and analytics (sales, pricing, state change timestamps)

**Offline Resilience:**
- Local state management for unstable connections
- Queue pending actions when offline
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Progressive sync when connection restored

### Code Structure

**Modular Organization:**
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/           # Shared types and error definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/        # Route components (/cashier, /bar, /admin, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Business logic UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design_system/ # Design system components (atoms, molecules, theme)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/    # Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Text, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ molecules/ # Compound components (FormField, ThemeSwitcher, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/    # Theming system with tokens and variants
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ state/        # Frontend state management and hydration
â””â”€â”€ backend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ services/     # Leptos server functions (available to client & server)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ items.rs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ categories.rs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orders.rs
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ order_items.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ database/     # Database operations and records (SSR only)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ items.rs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ categories.rs
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ orders.rs
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ order_items.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ config.rs     # App configuration and environment variables
    â””â”€â”€ errors.rs     # Backend-specific error handling
```

**Entry Points:**
- `src/main.rs`: Axum server entry point for SSR builds
- `src/lib.rs`: WebAssembly hydration entry point for client builds
- `src/app.rs`: Main application component with routing and UI
- `end2end/`: Playwright test suite

**Configuration:**
- `.env` file for secrets and environment variables
- `backend/config.rs` for structured configuration management

The application uses Leptos's SSR (Server-Side Rendering) with hydration, where the server renders the initial HTML and the client takes over with WASM for interactivity. Leptos feature flags (`ssr` vs `hydrate`) handle compilation differences automatically.

**Backend Architecture:**
- **Services Layer** (`backend/services/`): Leptos server functions available to both client and server
  - Contains `#[server]` functions that handle API endpoints
  - Uses conditional compilation for SSR vs client-side access
  - Calls database layer functions for data operations
- **Database Layer** (`backend/database/`): SSR-only database operations and record types
  - Individual modules for each entity (items, categories, orders, order_items)
  - Contains database record types (e.g., `ItemRecord`) with timestamps and SurrealDB `Thing` IDs
  - Provides conversion functions from database records to common types
  - Handles direct SurrealDB interactions and queries
- **Configuration** (`backend/config.rs`): Environment-based configuration management
- **Error Handling** (`backend/errors.rs`): SurrealDB error conversions and backend-specific errors

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Server Functions over REST**: Eliminates API redundancy while maintaining clean backend layers
- **Two-Layer Backend Architecture**: Services layer (Leptos server functions) + Database layer (SSR-only operations)
- **Feature-gated Modules**: Database operations available only in SSR, services available to both client/server
- **SurrealDB Thing IDs**: Automatic ID generation with schema inference from Rust types
- **Simplified Common Types**: Frontend types exclude database-specific fields like timestamps and SurrealDB Thing IDs
- **Database Record Conversion**: Clean separation between database records and common types via `From` traits
- **Atomic Design System**: Comprehensive design system with atoms, molecules, and theming
- **Token-based Theming**: Light/dark mode support with variant system for consistent styling

**Design System Architecture:**
- **Atoms** (`frontend/design_system/atoms/`): Basic building blocks (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- **Molecules** (`frontend/design_system/molecules/`): Compound components (FormField, ThemeSwitcher, etc.)
- **Theme System** (`frontend/design_system/theme/`): Design tokens, variants, and theme context
- **Business Components** (`frontend/components/`): Application-specific UI using design system
- **Tailwind 4 Integration**: Utility-first CSS with design token mapping

This layered architecture ensures clean separation of concerns and makes the codebase maintainable and testable.

## Development Guidelines

### Dependency Management
- **NEVER** edit `Cargo.toml` manually for dependencies
- **ALWAYS** use `cargo add` command to add dependencies
- **ALWAYS** use `cargo remove` command to remove dependencies
- Use cargo flags for proper configuration: `--optional`, `--features`, `--no-default-features`
- This ensures latest compatible versions and proper feature handling

Examples:
```bash
cargo add surrealdb --features json
cargo add serde --features derive
cargo add tokio --optional --features full
cargo remove old-dependency
```

### Development Rules

**Frontend Development:**
- **ABSOLUTELY** stay Leptos idiomatic - use proper component patterns, signals, and reactivity
- **ALWAYS** use the design system (`frontend/design_system/`) for all UI components
- **NEVER** create inline components or styling - use existing atoms and molecules
- **ONLY** use Tailwind 4 classes within the design system components
- **NEVER** use Tailwind classes directly in business logic components (`frontend/components/`)
- **ALWAYS** compose UI using design system components with proper theming and variants
